//need to deal with time issue in database. borrower details in reservation model.
//add publication year as well in search
//count of how many overdues/bad debts and a strike or smth.

//file in includes folder for flash messages
//some changes in home.ejs

///adminPortal opening without asking user pass
//deal with the fact that you cant just get the password from the database when doing a call to the database
//can an admin cancel someones reservation? can the admin block someone from membership?



//user reserve add to cart?

//Tomm


//Can a user reserve multiple books at a time? then in reservation table, array like structure neded for bookId and copyId
//add images to books
//User should be able to reserve multiple copies. 
//Once he reserves he should be able to view his book statuses.(make this feature) then work on notifications

//if user delete his id, what happens to his reservations?



//Next step




//Many tasks to do, but this includes fundamanetal features to be done in backend


//The reservation should have search feature(me)
//Main page books and search there asÂ well.
//Settings page where admin can customize to his own liking.






//Admin has access to every user. He can see all reservations.take actions on them.

//User: view past reservation details, Admin: view past reservation details -> bad debt + completed (using filter)
//overdue logic and automated reservation cacnellation.(use a trigger)
//search feature for reservations(both current and past) (including filter of statuses)
//Send notification to user when overdue
//add image of book wherever being displayed

//clean code.

//i want a search option in admin reservation page with a search filter that should work as follows.

//1)You can search for books and borrower name(later adapt to where user can select what to search for)
//2)You can filter out the results based on the status of the reservation
//3)You can further filter\sort the results based on the date of reservation
//4) i want the user to have same code, but for him the search should be based on the book name and the status of the reservation and date of reservation


//1) almost implemented, then work on 2.


//Before all that, pull umer code.
//3)option to see all reservations (show all reservation button)
//2)Tommorow work on filters.(1-remove the badreservation related file/code(need to clean))
//4)organise all reservations for user and admin.



//small things, z-index of flash messages and overdue logic check.
//Clean all html css ,code, use includes and everything


//Tomm
//A button showing all reservations, when you search you only look at the filter.(also do a front end search no need for back end)
//clean code
//organise the reservation for user and admin

//A settings page for admin and customer.
//notifications?
//Contacting the admin?
//Front end betterment
