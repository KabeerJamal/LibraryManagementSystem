///adminPortal opening without asking user pass
//deal with the fact that you cant just get the password from the database when doing a call to the database
//can an admin cancel someones reservation? can the admin block someone from membership?



//user reserve add to cart?

//Tomm


//Can a user reserve multiple books at a time? then in reservation table, array like structure neded for bookId and copyId
//add images to books
//User should be able to reserve multiple copies. 
//Once he reserves he should be able to view his book statuses.(make this feature) then work on notifications

//if user delete his id, what happens to his reservations?



//Next step
// ya just design the user reservation details page
//cancel reservation
//collection
//if not returned add in bad debt
//reservations should have search feature.
//admin can see all reservations.(done)
//add image of book wherever being displayed
//search filter

//Many tasks to do, but this includes fundamanetal features to be done in backend

//Cancel reservations(me)
//2)Collection logic(me)
//if not returned, add in bad debt
//The reservation should have search feature(me)
//Main page books and search there asÂ well.
//Settings page where admin can customize to his own liking.







//User: view past reservation details, Admin: view past reservation details -> bad debt + completed (using filter)
//search feature for reservations(both current and past) (including filter of statuses)

//clean code.
