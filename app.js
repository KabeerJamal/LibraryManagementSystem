//Can a user reserve multiple books at a time? then in reservation table, array like structure neded for bookId and copyId
//add images to books
//User should be able to reserve multiple copies. 
//Once he reserves he should be able to view his book statuses.(make this feature) then work on notifications

//if user delete his id, what happens to his reservations?



//Next step
// ya just design the user reservation details page
//cancel reservation
//collection
//if not returned add in bad debt
//reservations should have search feature.
//admin can see all reservations.(done)
//add image of book wherever being displayed
//search filter

//Cancel reservations(me)
//2)Collection logic(me)
//if not returned, add in bad debt
//The reservation should have search feature(me)
//Main page books and search there asÂ well.
//Settings page where admin can customize to his own liking.




//Collected button, where we click, the status changes to collected, we get a collected date and due date, and reservation status cahnges to collected.
//the return date cahnges to not returned yet, with a returned button. 
//If we click return button, the status changes to returned, and we get a returned date.
//If return date passes due date, the status changes to bad debt and status has to change to something, like overdue or something.
//If collect date passed and book not collected, cancel reservation and status changes to cancelled.
//Also remove button once collected



//changes status dynamically as well when collected, returned.
//search feature for reservations
//clean code.
