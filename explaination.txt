Explanation of Project Structure
1. Router File
Purpose: Handles all the routes in the application.
Example Routes:
app.get('/'): Handles GET requests to the home page.
app.post('/register'): Handles POST requests to the registration page.
2. Controller Folder
File: userController.js
Purpose: Contains functions that are called when specific routes are accessed.
When a route is accessed (e.g., /register), the corresponding function in userController.js is executed.
3. Model Folder
File: User.js
Purpose: Contains the User class which interacts with the database.
When userController needs to interact with the database, it calls methods from the User class.
Workflow Example: User Registration
User Action:

A user fills out a registration form on the website.
Router Handling:

The form submission triggers a POST request to /register.
The router detects this request and calls the corresponding function in userController.
Controller Handling:

In userController, the function retrieves user information from req.body.
The function then passes this information to the User class in the model folder.
Model Handling:

The User class uses the provided information to interact with the database.
It performs necessary operations (e.g., inserting the user data into the database).
Returning Data:

The result from the database interaction is returned to userController.
userController processes this result and sends an appropriate response back to the user.
Summary
Router: Manages all routes and directs requests to appropriate controller functions.
Controller: Contains functions that handle the logic for each route, including processing data and interacting with models.
Model: Defines classes (e.g., User) that interact directly with the database to perform CRUD operations.
This organized structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the code easier to manage and maintain.




Local Environment

Server runs on:

http://localhost:3000


.env contains local DB credentials:

PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=yourpassword
DB_NAME=mydatabase


Connects to your local MySQL database.

Deployed Environment (Render + Railway)

Render: Provides a PORT (dynamic). Use:

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);


Railway: Provides database credentials like:

DB_HOST=trolley.proxy.rlwy.net
DB_PORT=41885
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=generated_password
DB_NAME=railway


These must be added in Render's Environment Variables settings.

Switching Automatically

Your db.js can look like:

require('dotenv').config();

const mysql = require('mysql2');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME
});

module.exports = connection;


This way:

Local .env → connects to local DB.

Render .env → connects to Railway DB.

Yes. Render lets you set environment variables in its dashboard. There, you provide the remote database host, port, user, password, and name (from Railway) so your app can connect in production.
